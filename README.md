Building algorithm for Wordle

<a href = 'https://github.com/zmwm37/wordle-wodel.git'>Wordle</a> is an English word game developed by Josh Wardle that involves trying to guess a five letter word in 6 or fewer guesses. There are 12,972 accepted wordle answers that are English words with 5 letters. The game can be played once a day with a new answer each day.

My goal is to build an algorithm that can successfully guess the word in 6 or fewer attempts each day.

## Dev Tasks
- Select start word or word after no matches  
- Pick word from exact matching list (greens only, no yellow)  
- Pick word from partial match (only yellows)  
- Pick word from combined partial-exact matching list (greens and yellows)  
- Interface for taking input and displaying guessed word
